The following have been added or changed:

- Increased emergency cell search count for boats struggling to enter a map with a lot of mountains along the coastline.

- Added the ability to drop cargo items directly from the boats inventory.

- Animals will now automatically board into passenger seats when selecting a group of pawns to board.

- Fixed bug involving Waypoints

- Fixed bug where work priorities would be reset upon exiting a boat.

- Reseating has been improved and optimized. If your boat has enough pawns to set sail but they are in the wrong seats, drafting will now reseat them by priority.</description>
